  "summary": "REQ-12 is partially addressed via a new Node preflight script and runtime diagnostics, but there is no evidence it is integrated into the build/deploy pipeline. REQ-11 is not met: the diff adds browser-console diagnostics rather than capturing full build/deploy logs in the platform build output, and there are no shown minimal config fixes (e.g., dfx.json/vite/canister config) to ensure a clean deploy succeeds. Several added UI/branding changes appear outside the stated scope and non-goals.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-11",
      "requirement": "Identify the root cause of the previous Internet Computer deployment failure (\"Unable to complete deployment\") by capturing the full build/deploy logs and making the minimal code/config changes needed so a clean deploy succeeds.",
      "reason": "The diff shows added frontend runtime console logging/error boundary, but no evidence of capturing full build/deploy logs in build output (CI/platform) and no evidence of actual deployment configuration fixes (e.g., dfx.json/canister build config) that would make a clean deploy succeed.",

      "requirement": "Add a lightweight preflight validation step to the project build that checks for required Internet Computer project files/configuration and fails with clear English messages when prerequisites are missing or inconsistent.",
      "reason": "A preflight script is added, but the diff does not show it being invoked by the project build/deploy (no package.json/scripts, CI config, or deploy command wiring shown). Without integration, it is not a build 'step' that fails early.",
